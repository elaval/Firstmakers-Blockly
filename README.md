# Firstmakers-Blockly
First makers is an initiative aimed at making easy the adventure of programming our physical environment and allowing ordinary people to build the Internet of things.

First makers includes hardware (e.g. a shield that can be placed on top of Arduino boards with built-in sensors and plugs to connect external sensors/actuators), software (Block based software to program electronic boards) and cloud services (save and share your data).

This repository contains the base code for Firstmakers "Blockly version", based on Google's blockly software (https://developers.google.com/blockly/)
